# DevOps and Infrastructure Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines a strategic roadmap for improving the DevOps practices and infrastructure of the French Novel Tool. The goal is to automate processes, improve reliability, and create a scalable and secure production environment.

## Phase 1: CI/CD and Environment Parity (Short-Term)

**Objective:** Automate the build and deployment pipeline, and ensure consistency between development and production environments.

- [ ] **Implement a CI/CD Pipeline:**
    -   **Action:** Automate testing, building, and deploying the application.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Use **GitHub Actions** to create a workflow that triggers on every push to the `main` branch.
        -   **CI (Continuous Integration):** The workflow should:
            -   Install dependencies for both `frontend` and `backend`.
            -   Run linters and formatters (`ESLint`, `Black`).
            -   Run all backend and frontend tests.
        -   **CD (Continuous Deployment):** If CI passes, the workflow should:
            -   Build Docker images for the frontend and backend.
            -   Push the images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
            -   Deploy the new images to the production environment.

- [ ] **Containerize for Production:**
    -   **Action:** Use the existing `docker-compose.yml` as a foundation for a production-ready setup.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Create a `docker-compose.prod.yml` that is optimized for production.
        -   Use a production-grade web server like **Gunicorn** for the Flask backend instead of the development server.
        -   Use a reverse proxy like **Nginx** or **Traefik** to manage incoming traffic, serve the Next.js frontend, and route API requests to the backend.
        -   Configure the reverse proxy to handle HTTPS termination with SSL certificates.

- [ ] **Manage Secrets Securely:**
    -   **Action:** Stop using hardcoded secrets or environment files in production.
    -   **Implementation:** Use Docker Compose's support for secrets or integrate a secrets management tool like **HashiCorp Vault** or cloud-provider solutions (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager). The CI/CD pipeline would be responsible for injecting these secrets at deploy time.

## Phase 2: Monitoring, Logging, and Scalability (Mid-Term)

**Objective:** Gain visibility into the application's health and performance, and prepare for scaling.

- [ ] **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:**
    -   **Action:** Aggregate logs and metrics from all services into a centralized platform.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Deploy a monitoring stack like the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or a cloud-native solution like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
        -   Configure the backend to output structured (JSON) logs.
        -   Configure the reverse proxy and application containers to ship logs and metrics to the monitoring platform.
        -   Create dashboards to visualize key metrics (e.g., request latency, error rates, CPU/memory usage).

- [ ] **Implement Health Checks and Alerting:**
    -   **Action:** Proactively detect and respond to issues.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Use the existing `/health` endpoint in the backend for container health checks in Docker Compose or a future orchestration system.
        -   Set up alerting rules in the monitoring platform (e.g., Grafana Alerting) to notify the team via Slack or email if error rates spike or services become unresponsive.

- [ ] **Transition to a Container Orchestrator:**
    -   **Action:** Move from `docker-compose` to a more scalable and resilient platform.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Migrate the application to **Kubernetes (K8s)** or a simpler alternative like **Docker Swarm** or **HashiCorp Nomad**.
        -   This will provide benefits like automated scaling, self-healing (restarting failed containers), and rolling updates with zero downtime.

## Phase 3: Security and Cost Optimization (Long-Term)

**Objective:** Harden the infrastructure and optimize operational costs.

- [ ] **Automate Infrastructure Provisioning (Infrastructure as Code):**
    -   **Action:** Define and manage infrastructure using code.
    -   **Implementation:** Use a tool like **Terraform** or **Pulumi** to provision all cloud resources (e.g., virtual machines, databases, networking). This makes the infrastructure reproducible, version-controlled, and easier to manage.

- [ ] **Implement a Staging Environment:**
    -   **Action:** Create a production-like environment for final testing before deploying to production.
    -   **Implementation:** The CI/CD pipeline should be updated to first deploy new changes to a staging environment. After successful validation (automated E2E tests and manual review), the changes can be promoted to production with a manual approval step.

- [ ] **Conduct Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    -   **Action:** Proactively identify and fix security vulnerabilities in the infrastructure.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Use automated tools to scan container images for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `Trivy`, `Clair`).
        -   Periodically engage in manual or automated penetration testing to simulate attacks and identify weaknesses in the network configuration, application, and dependencies.

- [ ] **Optimize Cloud Costs:**
    -   **Action:** Analyze and reduce infrastructure spending.
    -   **Implementation:**
        -   Use cloud provider tools to monitor costs.
        -   Implement auto-scaling policies to only use resources when needed.
        -   Consider using spot instances for non-critical workloads like development or testing environments.
