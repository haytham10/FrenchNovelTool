## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that all contributors are expected to follow:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive criticism
- Show empathy towards others
- Accept responsibility and apologize for mistakes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git
- Google Cloud account with Gemini and Drive/Sheets APIs enabled

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/french-novel-tool.git
   cd french-novel-tool
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/french-novel-tool.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Initialize database
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade

# Run the development server
flask --app run.py run
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API URL

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup (Optional)

```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up --build
```

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in logical, focused commits
3. Keep commits atomic and well-described

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(backend): add rate limiting to API endpoints

Implemented Flask-Limiter to add rate limiting protection
to all API endpoints. Configurable via environment variables.

Closes #123
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

**Example:**
```python
def process_sentences(text: str, max_length: int = 8) -> List[str]:
    """
    Process text and split into sentences with maximum length.
    
    Args:
        text: The input text to process
        max_length: Maximum word count per sentence
        
    Returns:
        List of processed sentences
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If text is empty or max_length is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Uploads a PDF file and processes it using the backend API
 * @param file - The PDF file to upload
 * @returns Promise resolving to array of processed sentences
 * @throws Error if upload fails or file is invalid
 */
async function processPdf(file: File): Promise<string[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Code Formatting

We use automated code formatters:

- **Python**: Black
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: ESLint with auto-fix

Install pre-commit hooks to format automatically:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Now your code will be automatically formatted before each commit.

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html  # With coverage
```

Write tests for:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Edge cases
- API endpoints
- Service layer functions

**Example:**
```python
def test_process_pdf_success(client, mock_gemini):
    """Test successful PDF processing"""
    data = {'pdf_file': (io.BytesIO(b'test pdf'), 'test.pdf')}
    response = client.post('/api/v1/process-pdf', data=data)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert 'sentences' in response.json
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage  # With coverage
```

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR:
1. Test the feature manually in the browser
2. Test error cases
3. Test on different screen sizes (responsive design)
4. Check console for errors or warnings

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality
2. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes
3. **Run linters** and fix any issues:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   black .
   flake8
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run lint
   ```
4. **Run tests** and ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   pytest
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm test
   ```
5. **Update CHANGELOG** (if applicable)
6. **Rebase on latest main**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

### Creating a Pull Request
