# Progress Bar Completely Missing - Frontend Issue

## Current Status

After deployment, the progress bar is now **completely missing**! The UI shows:
- "Processing PDF in background..."
- "Real-time updates active" âœ…
- But **NO progress percentage**
- But **NO progress bar visual**

## What This Means

The frontend is **not receiving** the initial job state when joining the room.

## Root Cause

Looking at `socket_events.py` line 127 (in `handle_join_job`):

```python
# Send initial job state
emit('job_progress', job.to_dict(), room=room)
```

This sends the initial state when the user joins the room, but the frontend might not be receiving it or handling it correctly.

## Backend Logs Show

```
[2025-10-11 11:07:47,354] INFO in socket_events: WebSocket connected: user_id=2
[2025-10-11 11:07:47,542] INFO in socket_events: User 2 joined room job_75
```

The backend says the user joined, but we don't see:
- "Emitting job_progress to room=job_75" (from the initial emit)
- Any `[EMIT_PROGRESS]` logs during processing

## Two Separate Issues

### Issue 1: Initial Progress Not Shown (Frontend)
The initial `job_progress` event when joining the room isn't being handled properly.

**Quick Fix**: Check `frontend/src/lib/useJobWebSocket.ts` and ensure it handles the initial state.

### Issue 2: Real-time Progress Still Not Updating (Backend)
The `[EMIT_PROGRESS]` logs are **still missing**, which means:
- Either the new code didn't deploy to the worker
- Or `emit_progress()` is being called but failing silently

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Check Railway Deployment Status

```bash
# Check which services were deployed
railway status

# List all services
railway service

# Check worker service specifically
railway logs --service=worker-service-name --tail
```

### 2. Verify New Code on Worker

```bash
# SSH into worker
railway ssh --service=worker-service-id

# Check if new code is there
grep -n "\[EMIT_PROGRESS\]" /app/app/tasks.py
# Should show: logger.info(f"[EMIT_PROGRESS] Starting emission for job {job_id}")

# If not found, the worker didn't redeploy!
```

### 3. Manually Trigger Worker Redeploy

If the worker didn't redeploy automatically:

```bash
# In Railway dashboard or CLI
railway redeploy --service=worker-service-name
```

## Frontend Fix Needed

Even if backend works, we need to fix the initial progress display. The frontend should show the progress percentage from the initial `job_progress` event.

Check `frontend/src/lib/useJobWebSocket.ts` around line 90-110 where it handles the `job_progress` event.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **On join**: Frontend receives initial job state and shows "Processing (15%)"
2. **During processing**: `[EMIT_PROGRESS]` logs appear, progress updates in real-time
3. **On completion**: Progress reaches 100%, job status changes to "completed"

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify worker service redeployed
2. If not, manually redeploy worker
3. Test again and check for `[EMIT_PROGRESS]` logs
4. Fix frontend to show initial progress state
