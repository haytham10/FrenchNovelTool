## 🎯 What This PR Delivers

### 1. **Word List Management** (Settings Page)
Users can now:
- Upload CSV files with automatic word list parsing
- Import word lists from Google Sheets
- View ingestion reports (duplicates, variants, anomalies)
- Set a default word list for coverage runs
- Delete user-owned word lists
- Distinguish between global and personal word lists

**UI Location**: `/settings` → Vocabulary Coverage Settings section  
**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented (was already in codebase)

---

### 2. **Standalone Coverage Page** (`/coverage`)
A dedicated page for running vocabulary coverage analysis with:

**Configuration Panel**:
- Mode selector: Coverage (comprehensive) vs Filter (optimized drilling)
- Word list selector with default highlighting
- Source selector from processing history with search
- Smart defaults (uses user → global default word list)

**Execution**:
- One-click run with validation
- Live progress updates (2-second polling)
- Status indicators and error handling

**Results Display**:
- Summary KPIs (words covered, sentences selected, acceptance ratio)
- Mode-specific result tables (see below)
- Export to Google Sheets or download CSV

**URL Support**: Direct navigation via `/coverage?runId=123`

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with all planned features

---

### 3. **Coverage Run CTAs** (Job & History Integration)

**New Component**: `CoverageRunDialog`
- Reusable dialog for launching coverage runs
- Pre-fills source context (job/history ID + filename)
- Allows mode and word list customization
- Navigates to coverage page on success

**Integration Points**:
- **Job Completion**: "Run Vocabulary Coverage" button appears when job completes
- **History Details**: "Vocabulary Coverage" button in history detail dialog

**User Flow**: 
```
Process PDF → Complete → Click CTA → Configure → Run → View Results
```

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented

---

### 4. **Advanced Results Display**

#### **Coverage Mode** (`CoverageResultsTable`)
Displays word-to-sentence assignments with:
- Search by word or sentence text
- Pagination (10/25/50/100 per page)
- Word normalization info (original vs normalized)
- Matched surface form display
- Manual edit indicators (orange chip)
- Swap action buttons (UI ready for backend)

**Perfect for**: Teachers ensuring complete vocabulary coverage

#### **Filter Mode** (`FilterResultsTable`)
Displays ranked sentences optimized for drilling with:
- **Stats Summary**: Total, avg length, avg score, score range
- **Visual Ranking**: Stars for top 10, progress bars for scores
- **Color Coding**: Green=4 words (ideal), Blue=3 words, Gray=other
- Search and pagination
- Exclude action buttons (UI ready for backend)

**Perfect for**: Language learners doing daily repetition drills

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with rich visual feedback
