"""
find_redundant_sentences.py

This file previously contained a diagnostic script to detect redundant sentences in
coverage analysis outputs. The diagnostics and generated artifacts have been cleaned
from the repository workspace to keep it tidy.

To re-run redundancy checks, restore this file from version control or recreate the
analysis script using the project's analysis notes.
