**Implementation:** Enhanced `NormalizeControls` component with collapsible advanced options, live preview textarea, and Gemini model dropdown.

### 2) Export Enhancements ✅
- ✅ Append to existing Sheet (choose tab or create new tab) - UI ready
- ✅ Customizable headers and column order
- ✅ Share settings: add collaborators; toggle "Anyone with link can view" - UI ready

**Implementation:** New `ExportDialog` component with comprehensive export options, including mode selection, header customization, and sharing settings.

### 3) Results Table Power-User Features ✅

**Implementation:** Enhanced `HistoryTable` with detailed error display and action buttons for retry and duplicate operations.

### 5) Usability, Copy, and States ✅

### 7) Testing & Reliability ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ⚠️ Integration tests with mocked Google APIs - requires CI/CD infrastructure
- ⚠️ Visual regression tests - requires testing infrastructure
