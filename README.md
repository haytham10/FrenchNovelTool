This full-stack application provides a seamless workflow for literary analysis, featuring a sophisticated credit system, robust job tracking, and a polished, responsive user interface built with Next.js and Material-UI.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- üìÑ **PDF Text Extraction**: Upload PDF files and extract raw text content on the server.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Normalization**: Utilizes Google Gemini to intelligently split long sentences while preserving their original meaning and context.
- üìä **Google Sheets Export**: Export processed sentences directly to a new Google Sheet, with automatic header formatting.
- üìÅ **Google Drive Integration**: Organize exported spreadsheets into user-specified folders in Google Drive.
- üìö **Vocabulary Coverage Tool** *(New)*: Analyze sentences based on high-frequency vocabulary lists for optimized language learning:
    - **Filter Mode**: Find sentences with ‚â•95% common words (4-8 words) for drilling - perfect for rapid vocabulary acquisition
    - **Coverage Mode**: Select minimal sentence set covering all target words for comprehensive learning
    - **Word List Management**: Upload/manage custom word lists (CSV), with French 2K global default
    - **spaCy NLP**: Intelligent lemmatization handles plurals, conjugations, and elisions (l', d')

### Credit & Job Tracking System
- üí≥ **Monthly Credit Allocation**: Users receive a monthly grant of credits for processing documents.
- üìà **Usage-Based Pricing**: A pay-per-use model where credits are consumed based on the number of tokens processed and the AI model selected.
- üîÑ **Two-Phase Commit Accounting**:
    1. **Preflight Estimate**: Get a cost estimate before committing to a job.
    2. **Credit Reservation**: Credits are "soft-reserved" when a job is confirmed.
    3. **Finalization**: After processing, the actual credit cost is calculated, and the user's balance is adjusted.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Job Tracking & History**: A complete audit trail of all processing jobs, including status, cost, and links to results.
- üí∞ **Transparent Ledger**: A detailed credit ledger provides a full history of all transactions (grants, reservations, final costs, and refunds).

### Authentication & Security
- üîê **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens with automated token refresh.
- üîë **Google OAuth 2.0**: Seamless and secure user login via Google accounts, requesting necessary permissions for Google Sheets and Drive.
- üõ°Ô∏è **API Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **CORS Protection**: Whitelist-based Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to secure the API.
- üìù **Schema Validation**: All incoming API requests are validated against Marshmallow schemas to prevent invalid data.

### User Experience & Interface
- üé® **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive interface built with Next.js 15 and Material-UI v7.
- üåì **Light/Dark Mode**: Switch between themes for user comfort.
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Inline Editing**: Directly edit normalized sentences in the results table before exporting.
- üîç **Debounced Search & Filtering**: Fast, responsive filtering in the processing history table.
- üîî **Real-Time Notifications**: Toast notifications for all major actions (success, error, info).
- ‚è≥ **Context-Aware Loading**: Full-page overlays and granular loading indicators provide clear feedback during authentication, file processing, and data fetching.
- ‚ôø **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind, including semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a modern, decoupled architecture with a service-oriented backend and a reactive frontend.

- **Backend (Flask)**: A robust API built with a service layer that encapsulates all business logic (e.g., `CreditService`, `JobService`, `PDFService`). This promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase modular and testable. Flask Blueprints are used to organize routes by functionality (auth, credits, main).

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: A server-side rendered (SSR) React application using the App Router. It communicates with the backend via a centralized API client (axios) that handles automatic JWT token refresh. Global state is managed with Zustand, while server state and data fetching are handled by TanStack Query.

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: A relational database managed by SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate. The schema is designed to support the credit system, job tracking, and user data.

- **Authentication Flow**:
  1. Frontend initiates Google OAuth 2.0 login.
  2. Backend receives the Google auth code, validates it, and creates a user record.
  3. Backend generates a JWT access token and a refresh token.
  4. Frontend stores the tokens, using the access token for API requests. An axios interceptor automatically uses the refresh token to get a new access token when it expires.
