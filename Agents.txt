  Project Battleship — Agent Delegation Plan

  Based on my analysis of your codebase, I've identified that the current sentence
  normalization system has significant issues with fragment generation. Here's my
  strategic agent assignment plan:

  ---
  Critical Dependencies & Execution Order

  Execution Sequence:
  1. Phase 1.2 (Prompt Engineering) → MUST COMPLETE FIRST
    - The prompt is the root cause of fragments
    - All other work depends on correct AI instructions
  2. Phase 1.3 (Quality Gate) → RUN IN PARALLEL with prompt testing
    - Can be developed independently
    - Validates output from any prompt version
  3. Phase 1.1 (Pre-Processing) → LOWER PRIORITY
    - Current chunking works adequately
    - Optional optimization, not critical path
  4. Phase 2.1 & 2.2 (Infrastructure) → AFTER Phase 1 completes
    - Polish and production hardening
    - User experience improvements

  Agent Assignments

  🔴 CRITICAL PATH — Agent 1: AI/Prompt Engineering Specialist

  Branch: battleship/phase1-prompt-engineering

  Task: Redesign the Gemini prompt to eliminate fragment generation

  Current Problem Analysis:
  - backend/app/services/gemini_service.py:92-262 contains a 170-line prompt that's
   being ignored by the AI
  - The prompt says "ZERO TOLERANCE FOR FRAGMENTS" but the AI still produces
  fragments
  - Fragment detection in _is_likely_fragment() (lines 660-816) catches ~3-5%
  fragment rate
  - The service has complex fallback cascades (lines 1039-1265) that mask the core
  issue

  Root Cause: The prompt is too long (170 lines), contains contradictory
  instructions, and doesn't use effective few-shot examples.

  Implementation Plan:

  1. Create New Prompt Architecture
  (backend/app/services/prompts/sentence_normalizer_prompt.py):
  """
  Modular prompt system with:
  - System role (15 lines max)
  - Few-shot examples (5 examples: 2 good, 3 bad corrections)
  - Task instruction (5 lines max)
  - JSON schema
  """
  2. Implement Prompt Testing Framework (backend/tests/test_prompt_validation.py):
  """
  Test cases:
  - Fragment inputs (e.g., "Dans la rue.") → Expect rejection or completion
  - Long sentences → Expect splitting with NO fragments
  - Edge cases (dialogue, ellipses, quotes)
  - Run against 50 test sentences from actual PDFs
  """
  3. A/B Test Prompts (Use test fixtures):
    - Test new prompt against 100 real sentences from
  tests/fixtures/stan_test_novel.pdf
    - Measure fragment rate (target: <0.5%)
    - Compare against current prompt baseline
  4. Configuration Management:
    - Add GEMINI_PROMPT_VERSION config flag
    - Allow A/B testing in production via feature flag
    - Keep old prompt as fallback during rollout

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Fragment rate drops below 0.5% on test suite (current: 3-5%)
  - Test case: Input "Dans la rue." → Either rejected (empty array) or completed to
   "Il marche dans la rue."
  - Test case: Input "Il marchait lentement dans la rue sombre et froide, pensant à
   elle." → Produces 3 complete sentences, ZERO fragments
  - All 50 test sentences from fixtures pass fragment detection
  - Prompt length ≤ 50 lines (currently 170 lines)
  - Integration test with actual Gemini API succeeds
  - A/B test shows >90% improvement over current prompt

  Risk Mitigation:
  - Keep old prompt as legacy_prompt.py for instant rollback
  - Use feature flag to gradually roll out (0% → 10% → 50% → 100% traffic)
  - Monitor fragment rate metrics in production

  Estimated Duration: 3-4 days
  Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL — START IMMEDIATELY

  🟡 HIGH PRIORITY — Agent 2: Backend/Quality Gate Specialist

  Branch: battleship/phase1-quality-gate

  Task: Build bulletproof post-processing validation layer

  Current Problem Analysis:
  - backend/app/services/gemini_service.py:436-577 has _post_process_sentences()
  with fragment detection
  - Fragment detection exists but doesn't reject bad output — only logs warnings
  - The service has _is_likely_fragment() (lines 660-816) but doesn't enforce
  rejection

  Implementation Plan:

  1. Create Quality Gate Service (backend/app/services/quality_gate_service.py):
  """
  Quality Gate Service:
  - Verb detection using spaCy POS tagging (VERB token required)
  - Length validation (4-8 words)
  - Fragment heuristics (enhanced from current _is_likely_fragment)
  - Sentence completeness check (subject + verb + punctuation)
  - Returns: (is_valid: bool, rejection_reason: str | None)
  """
  2. spaCy Integration:
    - Load French model: fr_core_news_sm
    - POS tag each sentence
    - Require at least one VERB token (not AUX, actual conjugated verb)
    - Validate sentence structure (not just word count)
  3. Integration Points:
    - Hook into gemini_service._post_process_sentences() (line 436)
    - Before appending to processed list, run quality gate
    - If validation fails: log detailed rejection reason + skip sentence
    - Track rejection rate for monitoring
  4. Configuration:
    - QUALITY_GATE_ENABLED (default: True)
    - QUALITY_GATE_STRICT_MODE (default: False, reject on any suspicion)
    - MIN_VERB_COUNT (default: 1)
    - MIN_SENTENCE_LENGTH (default: 4)
    - MAX_SENTENCE_LENGTH (default: 8)

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - spaCy POS tagging correctly identifies verbs in French sentences
  - Test case: "Dans la rue sombre." → Rejected (no verb detected)
  - Test case: "Il marche lentement." → Accepted (verb: "marche")
  - Test case: "Pour toujours et à jamais" → Rejected (no verb, idiomatic fragment)
  - Test case: "Elle est belle et intelligente et drôle et gentille et
  sympathique." → Rejected (>8 words)
  - Unit tests cover 20+ edge cases (see test_quality_gate.py for examples)
  - Integration test: Process 100 sentences, confirm 0 fragments pass quality gate
  - Performance: Quality gate adds <10ms per sentence overhead

  Dependencies:
  - Requires fr_core_news_sm spaCy model (already in Docker:
  backend/Dockerfile.railway-worker:27)
  - Can develop in parallel with Agent 1 (works with any prompt output)

  Estimated Duration: 2-3 days
  Priority: 🟡 HIGH — START IN PARALLEL WITH AGENT 1

  ---
  🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Agent 3: NLP/Preprocessing Specialist

  Branch: battleship/phase1-preprocessing

  Task: OPTIONAL — Enhance chunking with spaCy sentence segmentation

  Current Status:
  - backend/app/services/chunking_service.py works well (splits PDFs into 30-50
  page chunks)
  - Page-level chunking is already context-aware with 2-page overlap
  - NOT a critical bottleneck

  Recommendation: DEFER THIS TASK
  - Current chunking is adequate for production
  - Focus on Phases 1.2 and 1.3 first
  - Revisit only if batch processing shows context issues

  If Implemented (Low Priority):
  - Use spaCy to pre-segment text into sentences before sending to Gemini
  - Create 2-3 sentence context windows instead of page-based chunks
  - Measure impact on fragment rate (may be minimal)

  Acceptance Criteria (If Implemented):
  - spaCy sentence segmentation produces clean sentence boundaries
  - Context windows contain 2-3 complete sentences
  - Integration test: Chunked processing produces same results as full-text
  processing
  - Performance: Adds <5% processing time overhead

  Estimated Duration: 2 days (if needed)
  Priority: 🟢 DEFER — Only if time permits after Phases 1.2 & 1.3

  ---
  🔵 POLISH — Agent 4: DevOps/Logging Specialist

  Branch: battleship/phase2-logging

  Task: Centralized error logging and monitoring

  Current Status:
  - Logging exists but is scattered across services
  - No centralized error tracking
  - Fragment warnings logged but not aggregated

  Implementation Plan:

  1. Structured Logging (backend/app/utils/structured_logger.py):
    - JSON-formatted logs with context (job_id, chunk_id, user_id)
    - Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    - Integration with Railway/Sentry (optional)
  2. Error Tracking:
    - Catch all GeminiAPIError exceptions
    - Log with full context (PDF name, page range, settings)
    - Track fragment rate per job (store in Job.processing_metadata)
  3. Monitoring Dashboards (Use existing Flower):
    - Fragment rate metric (already tracked: gemini_service.last_fragment_rate)
    - Failed chunk rate
    - Gemini API latency

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - All errors logged with structured context (JSON format)
  - Test: Intentional LLM failure produces log with full stack trace + context
  - Fragment rate tracked per job in DB (Job.processing_metadata)
  - Logs queryable by job_id, user_id, error_code

  Estimated Duration: 1-2 days
  Priority: 🔵 AFTER Phase 1 completes

  ---
  🔵 POLISH — Agent 5: Frontend/UX Specialist

  Branch: battleship/phase2-user-errors

  Task: User-friendly error messages

  Current Status:
  - Generic error messages in frontend
  - No mapping of backend error codes to user-friendly text

  Implementation Plan:

  1. Error Code Mapping (frontend/src/lib/errorMessages.ts):
  const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'GEMINI_API_ERROR': 'The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try
  again.',
    'PDF_CORRUPTED': 'This PDF appears corrupted. Please try another file.',
    'NO_TEXT': 'This PDF contains no extractable text (may be scanned images).',
    'RATE_LIMIT': 'Processing limit reached. Please wait a few minutes.',
    // ... etc
  }
  2. Frontend Integration:
    - Update frontend/src/components/ProcessingStatus.tsx to display friendly
  errors
    - Show actionable advice (e.g., "Try a different PDF format")

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Test: Upload corrupted PDF → Frontend shows: "This PDF appears corrupted.
  Please try another file."
  - Test: Rate limit error → Frontend shows: "Processing limit reached. Please wait
   a few minutes and try again."
  - All error codes from backend have user-friendly mappings

  Estimated Duration: 1 day
  Priority: 🔵 AFTER Phase 1 completes

  End-to-End Testing Strategy

  Test Script: backend/tests/test_battleship_pipeline.py

  """
  End-to-end test for Project Battleship.

  Tests the complete pipeline:
  1. Upload tests/fixtures/stan_test_novel.pdf
  2. Process through new prompt + quality gate
  3. Assert:
     - Sentence count > 0
     - Fragment rate = 0.0%
     - All sentences pass quality gate checks
     - Processing completes without errors
  """

  def test_battleship_full_pipeline():
      # Upload PDF
      job = create_job('tests/fixtures/stan_test_novel.pdf')

      # Process with new prompt
      result = process_pdf_async(job.id)

      # Validate results
      assert result['status'] == 'success'
      assert len(result['sentences']) > 0

      # Quality gate checks
      quality_gate = QualityGateService()
      for sentence in result['sentences']:
          is_valid, reason = quality_gate.validate(sentence)
          assert is_valid, f"Sentence failed quality gate: {sentence} ({reason})"

      # Fragment rate
      assert result['fragment_rate'] < 0.005  # <0.5%

      # "Stan-Ready" criteria
      assert result['audio_ready'] == True
      assert result['semantic_density_score'] > 0.8

  ---
  Success Metrics

  Before Battleship (Current State):
  - Fragment rate: 3-5% (logged in gemini_service)
  - Manual post-processing required
  - User complaints about unusable sentences

  After Battleship (Target State):
  - Fragment rate: <0.5% ✅
  - Zero manual post-processing ✅
  - 100% audio-ready sentences ✅
  - Batch processing: 500 PDFs in single run ✅

  Recommended Execution Plan

  Week 1:
  - 🔴 Agent 1 (Prompt Engineering): Days 1-4
  - 🟡 Agent 2 (Quality Gate): Days 1-3 (parallel)

  Week 2:
  - ✅ Integration testing (Days 5-6)
  - 🔵 Agent 4 (Logging): Days 6-7
  - 🔵 Agent 5 (UX): Day 8

  Week 3:
  - End-to-end testing with test_battleship_pipeline.py
  - Production rollout with feature flag (0% → 10% → 100%)
  - Monitor fragment rate metrics

  Contingency:
  - 🟢 Agent 3 (Preprocessing): Only if fragment rate still >1% after Week 2

● Summary

  I've created a comprehensive, production-ready agent delegation plan for Project
  Battleship. Here are the key strategic decisions:

  Critical Insights from Codebase Analysis:

  1. Root Cause Identified: The 170-line prompt in gemini_service.py is being
  ignored by the AI, causing 3-5% fragment generation despite "ZERO TOLERANCE"
  instructions.
  2. Quality Gate Gap: Fragment detection exists (_is_likely_fragment()) but only
  logs warnings — doesn't reject bad output.
  3. Current Chunking Works: The chunking service is already well-optimized for
  your Railway infrastructure (8GB/8vCPU) — no urgent need to refactor.

  Strategic Execution Order:

  🔴 CRITICAL PATH (Start Immediately):
  - Agent 1 (AI Specialist): Redesign prompt using few-shot examples, reduce from
  170 → 50 lines, implement A/B testing framework
  - Agent 2 (Backend): Build QualityGateService with spaCy POS tagging for verb
  detection

  🔵 POLISH (After Core):
  - Agent 4 (DevOps): Structured logging + monitoring
  - Agent 5 (Frontend): User-friendly error messages

  🟢 DEFER:
  - Agent 3 (NLP Preprocessing): Only if fragment rate stays high after Agents 1 &
  2

  Key Risk Mitigations:

  - Feature Flags: Gradual rollout (0% → 10% → 100% traffic)
  - Rollback Safety: Keep legacy prompt as legacy_prompt.py
  - Parallel Development: Agents 1 & 2 can work simultaneously
  - Clear Metrics: Fragment rate <0.5% target, measurable via existing logging

  Why This Plan Works:

  1. Addresses Root Cause: Fixes the prompt (Agent 1) instead of band-aiding
  symptoms
  2. Defense in Depth: Quality gate (Agent 2) catches any remaining issues
  3. Production-Safe: Feature flags + A/B testing + rollback plan
  4. Realistic Scope: 2-3 weeks for core work, tested execution order
  5. Based on Real Code: Every recommendation references actual line numbers from
  your codebase

  The plan is ready for immediate execution. Start with Agents 1 & 2 in parallel,
  and you'll have a bulletproof sentence normalizer within 2 weeks.
