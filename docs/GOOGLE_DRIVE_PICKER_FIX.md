# Google Drive Folder Picker - 502 Error Fix

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** 502 Bad Gateway when loading Google Drive Picker API  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem

The Google Drive folder picker was attempting to load the Discovery API endpoint:
```
https://content.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest?pp=0&fields=...&key=...
```

This was resulting in a **502 Bad Gateway** error, preventing users from selecting Google Drive folders during export.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The code was using the **deprecated approach** of pre-loading the Drive API discovery documents:

```typescript
// ❌ OLD (BROKEN)
const DISCOVERY_DOCS = ['https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest'];

gapiInstance.load('client:picker', () => {
  gapiInstance.client.init({
    apiKey: API_KEY,
    discoveryDocs: DISCOVERY_DOCS,  // 502 error here
  }).then(() => {
    setGapiLoaded(true);
  });
});
```

**Why it failed:**
1. The Discovery API endpoint can be flaky/rate-limited
2. The Google Picker API **doesn't require** pre-loading discovery docs
3. The `client.init()` call was unnecessary for the Picker use case

---

## ✅ Solution

**Simplified the initialization** to load only the Picker library:

```typescript
// ✅ NEW (WORKING)
const loadGapi = () => {
  const gapiInstance = window.gapi;
  if (!gapiInstance) {
    enqueueSnackbar('Google API client library failed to load.', { variant: 'error' });
    return;
  }
  
  // Load picker library only - it handles discovery internally
  gapiInstance.load('picker', () => {
    setGapiLoaded(true);
  });
};
```

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed `DISCOVERY_DOCS` constant
2. ✅ Changed `load('client:picker')` to `load('picker')`
3. ✅ Removed `gapiInstance.client.init()` call entirely
4. ✅ Picker API now initializes with just OAuth token + Developer Key

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ Console Error: Failed to load https://content.googleapis.com/.../drive/v3/rest
❌ "Select Folder" button disabled
❌ No folder picker UI appears
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ No console errors
✅ "Select Folder" button enabled
✅ Picker UI loads correctly
✅ Folder selection works as expected
```

## 📝 Files Changed

- **`frontend/src/components/DriveFolderPicker.tsx`**
  - Removed `DISCOVERY_DOCS` constant (line 59)
  - Updated comments to reflect Discovery API not needed
  - Simplified `loadGapi()` function (lines 109-117)
  - Removed error-prone `client.init()` call

---

## 🔧 Configuration Required

Make sure these environment variables are set in `frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

**Where to get these:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create/select a project
3. Enable **Google Picker API**
4. Create credentials:
   - **API Key** (for Picker initialization)
   - **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (for user authentication)

## 🌐 API Endpoints Now Used

| API | Endpoint | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| **Google Picker** | `https://apis.google.com/js/api.js` | Core Picker library |
| **Google Identity** | `https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client` | OAuth token client |
| ~~Drive Discovery~~ | ~~content.googleapis.com/discovery/...~~ | ❌ **No longer used** |

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

**No breaking changes** - this is a pure bug fix:
- ✅ Existing folder selections still work
- ✅ OAuth flow unchanged
- ✅ Backend API unchanged
- ✅ No database migrations needed

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Pull latest code
2. Rebuild frontend: `npm run build`
3. Redeploy to Vercel/production
