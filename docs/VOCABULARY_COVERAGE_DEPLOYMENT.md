- Settings page word list section (optional enhancement)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download French spaCy model
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_md
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# No new dependencies added
```

### 2. Database Migrations

```bash
cd backend

# Review the migration
cat migrations/versions/add_vocabulary_coverage_models.py

# Run migration
flask db upgrade

# Verify tables created
# Should see: word_lists, coverage_runs, coverage_assignments
# Plus: user_settings extended with default_wordlist_id, coverage_defaults_json
```

### 3. Seed Global Word List

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/seed_global_wordlist.py

# Expected output:
# Creating global default French 2K word list...
# ✓ Created global default word list: French 2K (Global Default)
#   ID: 1
#   Normalized count: ~200
#   Duplicates: 0
#   Multi-token entries: 0
```

**Note:** The seed script includes a sample of ~200 French words. For production, replace `FRENCH_2K_SAMPLE` in `scripts/seed_global_wordlist.py` with the full 2000-word list.

### 4. Verify Deployment

**Test Backend:**
```bash
# List word lists (should include French 2K default)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/v1/wordlists

# Expected response:
# {
#   "wordlists": [
#     {
#       "id": 1,
#       "name": "French 2K (Global Default)",
#       "is_global_default": true,
#       "normalized_count": 200,
#       ...
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

**Test Frontend:**
```bash
# Navigate to coverage page
open http://localhost:3000/coverage

# Should see:
# - Mode selector (Coverage/Filter)
# - Word list dropdown with "French 2K (Global Default)"
# - CSV upload section
# - Source selection (Job/History)
```

### 5. Production Configuration

**Environment Variables (if needed):**
```bash
# Backend .env
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Frontend .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

**Celery Worker:**
```bash
# Ensure Celery worker is running
cd backend
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Stan's Daily Drill Workflow (Filter Mode)

**Goal:** Get 500 sentences (4-8 words, ≥95% in 2K list) for 10 days of drilling.

1. **Process a French novel** (existing workflow)
   ```
   Upload PDF → Get Job ID 123
   ```

2. **Run Filter Mode coverage**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coverage/run
   {
     "mode": "filter",
     "source_type": "job",
     "source_id": 123,
     "wordlist_id": 1,  # French 2K default
     "config": {
       "min_in_list_ratio": 0.95,
       "len_min": 4,
       "len_max": 8,
       "target_count": 500
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Get results**
   ```bash
   GET /api/v1/coverage/runs/789
   
   # Returns:
   # - ~500 sentences
   # - Each 4-8 words
   # - Each ≥95% in 2K list
   # - Ranked by quality
   ```

4. **Export to Sheets** (when implemented)
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coverage/runs/789/export
   {
     "sheet_name": "French Drilling - Week 1"
   }
   ```

5. **Drill 50/day for 10 days**
   - Total: 500 sentences
   - Daily: 50 sentences
   - Duration: ~10 days

### Example 2: Teacher Creating Comprehensive Reading List (Coverage Mode)

**Goal:** Ensure all 2000 words are covered at least once.

1. **Run Coverage Mode**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coverage/run
   {
     "mode": "coverage",
     "source_type": "history",
     "source_id": 456,
     "wordlist_id": 1
   }
   ```

2. **Review coverage stats**
   ```json
   {
     "stats_json": {
       "words_total": 2000,
       "words_covered": 1850,
       "words_uncovered": 150,
       "selected_sentence_count": 423
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Manually assign uncovered words** (if needed)
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coverage/runs/789/swap
   {
     "word_key": "xylophone",
     "new_sentence_index": 100
   }
   ```

### Example 3: Custom Word List Upload

**Goal:** Use a custom 3K word list instead of default 2K.

1. **Prepare CSV file:**
   ```csv
   le
   chat
   manger
   dormir
   maison
   ...
   ```

2. **Upload via UI:**
   - Go to `/coverage`
   - Click "Choose File"
   - Select `french_3k.csv`
   - Click "Upload"

3. **Or upload via API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -F "file=@french_3k.csv" \
     -F "name=French 3K Custom" \
     -F "fold_diacritics=true" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/v1/wordlists
   ```

4. **Use in coverage run:**
   ```json
   {
     "mode": "filter",
     "source_type": "job",
     "source_id": 123,
     "wordlist_id": 2  // Use new custom list
   }
   ```

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check Coverage Run Status

**Via API:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/coverage/runs/789

# Status values:
# - pending: Queued
# - processing: Running
# - completed: Done
# - failed: Error
# - cancelled: User cancelled
```

**Via Database:**
```sql
SELECT id, mode, status, progress_percent, stats_json 
FROM coverage_runs 
WHERE user_id = 123 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Common Issues

**Issue: "No word list specified and no global default found"**
- **Cause:** Global default not seeded
- **Fix:** Run `python scripts/seed_global_wordlist.py`

**Issue: "Source has no sentences to analyze"**
- **Cause:** Job/History entry has no processed sentences
- **Fix:** Ensure source_id corresponds to completed job with results

**Issue: "spaCy model not found"**
- **Cause:** French model not downloaded
- **Fix:** Run `python -m spacy download fr_core_news_md`

**Issue: Low acceptance ratio (< 10%)**
- **Cause:** Word list too restrictive or sentences too complex
- **Fix:** 
  - Use larger word list (2K → 5K)
  - Lower min_in_list_ratio (0.95 → 0.85)
  - Expand length range (4-8 → 3-10)

### Performance Tuning

**Slow coverage runs:**
- Check Celery worker is running
- Monitor Redis/database performance
- Consider caching normalized word lists in Redis
- For large corpora (>10K sentences), consider async with WebSocket updates

**Database growth:**
- CoverageAssignment records can grow large
- Consider retention policy (e.g., delete runs > 90 days old)
- Index cleanup: `REINDEX TABLE coverage_assignments;`

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority (Post-MVP)

1. **Google Sheets Export**
   - Implement full export in `coverage_routes.py:export_coverage_run()`
   - Use existing `GoogleSheetsService`
   - Create tabs: Summary, Selected Sentences, Stats

2. **Job/History Page CTAs**
   - Add "Run Coverage Analysis" buttons
   - Pre-fill source_type and source_id
   - Modal for mode/wordlist selection

3. **Settings Page Integration**
   - Word list management section
   - Default word list selector
   - Coverage defaults (mode, thresholds)

### Medium Priority (Hardening)

4. **ILP Optimization (Coverage Mode)**
   - Add OR-Tools dependency
   - Implement pruned ILP with time cap
   - Fall back to greedy if timeout

5. **Diversity Controls (Filter Mode)**
   - Sentence clustering to reduce near-duplicates
   - Penalize repetitive sentence structures
   - Ensure variety in vocabulary usage

6. **Multi-Pass Matching**
   - Pass 1: Lemma lookup (current)
   - Pass 2: Inflection table lookup
   - Pass 3: Fuzzy matching with confidence
   - Pass 4: Human-in-the-loop assignment

7. **Full Word List Storage**
   - Store complete normalized word list in DB
   - Current: Only samples stored
   - Benefit: Faster lookups, no re-normalization

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)

8. **Google Sheets Import**
   - Import word list from Google Sheet URL
   - Auto-sync on updates

9. **Batch Export**
   - Export by date/tag for daily drills
   - Create separate tabs per day

10. **Analytics Dashboard**
    - Coverage run statistics over time
    - Word list usage metrics
    - User adoption tracking
