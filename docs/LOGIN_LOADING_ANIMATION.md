# Login Loading Animation Feature

## Overview
This feature adds a visual loading indicator (skeleton animation) in the header when a user is authenticating via Google OAuth.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **frontend/src/components/AuthContext.tsx**
   - Added `isAuthenticating` state to track when login/authentication is in progress
   - Updated `AuthContextValue` type to include `isAuthenticating: boolean`
   - Modified `loginWithCredential` to set `isAuthenticating` to `true` during login and `false` when complete
   - Modified `loginWithCode` to set `isAuthenticating` to `true` during login and `false` when complete

2. **frontend/src/components/Header.tsx**
   - Added `Skeleton` import from `@mui/material`
   - Added `isAuthenticating` to the destructured `useAuth()` values
   - Added conditional rendering to show a circular skeleton (32x32) when `isAuthenticating` is true
   - The skeleton replaces the GoogleLoginButton while authentication is in progress

### User Experience Flow

1. **Before Login**: User sees the "Sign in with Google" button in the header
2. **During Login**: 
   - User clicks "Sign in with Google"
   - Google OAuth popup appears
   - After user selects account and consents, the popup closes
   - A circular skeleton animation appears in the header (where the login button was)
   - Backend exchanges tokens and fetches user info
3. **After Login**: The skeleton is replaced with the user's avatar menu

### Accessibility
- Uses MUI's `Skeleton` component which includes built-in accessibility features
- The skeleton has proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Visual loading state helps users with cognitive disabilities understand the system is working

### Technical Notes
- The `isAuthenticating` state is independent from `isLoading` (which tracks initial app load)
- The skeleton animation only shows during active login operations, not during page load
- Both Google OAuth flows (credential and authorization code) show the loading indicator
- Error handling ensures `isAuthenticating` is set to `false` even if login fails (via `finally` block)

## Testing
- Build verification: ✅ Passes (no errors)
- Linting: ✅ Passes (no new warnings)
- Type checking: ✅ Passes (included in build process)
