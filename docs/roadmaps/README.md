## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Week 1 Priorities (Choose Your Track)

#### 🔴 Track A: Backend Stability (Recommended)
**Goal:** Establish testing foundation
```bash
cd backend
pip install pytest pytest-flask pytest-cov
mkdir -p tests/test_services
# Start writing tests for services
```
**Why first:** Can't deploy or refactor safely without tests

#### 🟠 Track B: Frontend Modernization
**Goal:** Implement proper state management
```bash
cd frontend
npm install zustand @tanstack/react-query
# Create stores in src/stores/
```
**Why first:** Foundation for all other frontend work

#### 🟡 Track C: DevOps Automation
**Goal:** Set up CI/CD pipeline
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
# Create backend-ci.yml and frontend-ci.yml
```
**Why first:** Automate testing and deployment early
