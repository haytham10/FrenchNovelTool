## Design Tokens Used

All components use the centralized design tokens from Phase A:
- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, success, warning, error from tokens
- **Spacing**: 8px baseline grid
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and line heights from tokens
- **Shadows**: Elevation system (0-6)
- **Transitions**: Cubic-bezier easing and timing
- **Border Radius**: 2 (8px) and 3 (12px) for rounded corners

## Accessibility Features ♿

### Keyboard Navigation
- ✅ All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- ✅ Upload surface works with Enter/Space keys
- ✅ Tab order is logical throughout
- ✅ Escape closes dialogs
- ✅ Enter/Escape for edit mode in table

### Screen Reader Support
- ✅ ARIA labels on all buttons and inputs
- ✅ ARIA descriptions for complex interactions
- ✅ ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- ✅ Form validation with aria-invalid

### Visual Accessibility
- ✅ Focus-visible styles on all interactive elements (3px solid outline)
- ✅ Sufficient color contrast ratios
- ✅ Visual feedback for all states (hover, active, disabled)
- ✅ No content relies solely on color

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities
- **ResultsTable**: Comment notes that virtualization (react-window) could be implemented for >5000 rows
- **Debounced Search**: Table search uses 300ms debounce to reduce re-renders
- **Memoization**: Sorted and filtered data is memoized with React.useMemo

## User Flow Validation ✅

The complete flow works without page reload:

1. **Upload** → User drops/selects PDF file
2. **Analyze** → File is processed, progress shown
3. **Normalize** → Sentences are normalized based on settings
4. **Export** → User exports to Google Sheets via modal

All stages have:
- ✅ Visual feedback (loaders, progress bars)
- ✅ Clear status messages
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Success confirmations

## Browser Compatibility

Tested features:
- ✅ CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- ✅ CSS custom properties (variables)
- ✅ Backdrop-filter (with fallback)
- ✅ Sticky positioning
- ✅ Modern CSS selectors (:focus-visible)

## Design Principles Applied

### Minimal, Flat Design
- Clean, uncluttered interfaces
- Flat colors without excessive gradients
- Simple, clear icons
- Generous white space

### Speed & Clarity
- Fast transitions (0.3s)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Immediate feedback for all actions
- Loading states for async operations

### Ease of Use
- Self-explanatory UI elements
- Helpful tooltips and descriptions
- Consistent patterns throughout
- Forgiving interactions (undo, cancel)

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Main page with hero, flow, and results
2. `frontend/src/components/UploadStepper.tsx` - Sticky stepper with numeric indicators
3. `frontend/src/components/FileUpload.tsx` - Enhanced drag-and-drop with vivid feedback
4. `frontend/src/components/ResultsTable.tsx` - Enhanced toolbar and sticky header
5. `frontend/src/components/ExportDialog.tsx` - Improved accessibility and validation

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Use
All Phase B components are ready for production use.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Virtualization**: Implement react-window for large datasets (>5000 rows)
2. **Animations**: Add micro-interactions with framer-motion
3. **Storybook**: Document components with interactive examples
4. **E2E Tests**: Add Playwright tests for complete user flows
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals

### Integration
Components are fully integrated with:
- Zustand store for state management
- React Query for API calls
- MUI theme system
- Existing authentication flow

## Conclusion

Phase B successfully delivers a modern, accessible, and engaging UI for the core processing flow. All acceptance criteria have been met:

✅ User can complete Upload → Analyze → Normalize → Export flow without reload
✅ Export modal is visually polished with correct tab order
✅ Keyboard-only users can complete the entire flow
✅ Skeletons and loaders provide feedback during all stages
✅ Components follow minimal, flat design principles
✅ All interactions are accessible and intuitive
