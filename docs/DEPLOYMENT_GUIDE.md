## 🛤️ Migration Path

### Stage 1: MVP (Months 1-3)
```
Railway
├── Backend (1 instance)
├── Celery workers (2 instances)
├── Redis (256MB)
└── PostgreSQL (1GB)

Cost: $23/month
Users: 0-50
```

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Response time > 500ms → Add worker
- Redis memory > 200MB → Upgrade to 1GB
- PostgreSQL storage > 800MB → Migrate to DO

---

### Stage 2: Growth (Months 4-12)
```
DigitalOcean App Platform
├── Backend (2 instances, auto-scale to 5)
├── Celery workers (3 instances, auto-scale to 10)
├── Managed Redis (1GB, HA)
└── Managed PostgreSQL (10GB, Multi-AZ)

Cost: $55-90/month
Users: 50-1000
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Export Railway PostgreSQL dump
2. Create DO App Platform project
3. Import database to DO Managed PostgreSQL
4. Update DNS to point to DO
5. Monitor for 24h, delete Railway

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Concurrent users > 500 → Consider AWS
- Database size > 8GB → Upgrade plan
- Monthly bill > $150 → Evaluate AWS cost

---

### Stage 3: Scale (Year 2+)
```
AWS ECS Fargate
├── Backend (2-50 tasks, auto-scale)
├── Celery workers (5-100 tasks, queue-based scaling)
├── ElastiCache Redis (2.5GB, Multi-AZ)
├── RDS PostgreSQL (100GB, Multi-AZ)
└── CloudFront CDN + S3

Cost: $175-1000/month (usage-based)
Users: 1000-100,000+
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Set up Terraform infrastructure
2. Deploy to AWS in parallel with DO
3. Use Route 53 weighted routing (90% DO, 10% AWS)
4. Gradually shift traffic (50/50, then 10/90)
5. Monitor costs and performance
6. Decommission DO after 1 week
