### Layout Structure

**Before:**
```tsx
<Container>
  <Typography>Title</Typography>
  <Paper>Configuration Panel</Paper>
  <Paper>Results Panel (if exists)</Paper>
  <Paper>Info Panel</Paper>
  <Dialog>Export Dialog</Dialog>
  <Dialog>Import Dialog</Dialog>
</Container>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Container>
  <Box>Title and Description</Box>
  
  {/* Three-Column Grid */}
  <Box sx={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: {...} }}>
    <Box>{/* Column 1: Configure */}</Box>
    <Box>{/* Column 2: Select Source */}</Box>
    <Box>{/* Column 3: Run & Review */}</Box>
  </Box>
  
  {/* Full Results Section */}
  {coverageRun?.status === 'completed' && (
    <Box id="full-results">...</Box>
  )}
  
  {/* Dialogs */}
  <Dialog>Help Dialog</Dialog>
  <Dialog>Export Dialog</Dialog>
  <Dialog>Import Dialog</Dialog>
  <Paper>Info Panel</Paper>
</Container>
```

### Key Component Changes

#### Column 1: Configuration (Static)
- Moved all configuration controls into a single sticky column
- Added numbered chip "1" for visual guidance
- Grouped related controls (mode, wordlist, sentence limit)
- Upload button integrated as "+ Upload New List" text button
- Removed redundant Alert messages (moved to help dialog)

#### Column 2: Source Selection (Interactive)
- Transformed dense List into card-based layout
- Each source now displayed as a Card with:
  - Icon (PDF or Sheets) for visual identification
  - Primary text (filename) in bold
  - Secondary text (metadata) in smaller font
  - Radio button for selection
- Added hover and selected states with visual feedback
- Search bar moved to top of column
- Import button styled consistently

#### Column 3: Run & Review (Dynamic)
- **Initial State:**
  - Large, prominent gradient button
  - Credit cost displayed as chip
  - Helper text when no source selected
  
- **Processing State:**
  - Progress bar with live percentage
  - WebSocket connection status indicator
  - Cancel button (currently disabled with note)
  
- **Completed State:**
  - KPI cards showing key metrics
  - Action buttons (Download CSV, Export to Sheets)
  - Results preview (first 10 entries)
  - "View Full Results Below" scroll button
  - "Start New Analysis" reset button
  
- **Failed State:**
  - Error alert with message
  - "Try Again" button

### Responsive Design

**Desktop (≥900px):**
```css
display: grid;
gridTemplateColumns: repeat(3, 1fr);
gap: 3; /* 24px */
```

**Mobile (<900px):**
```css
display: grid;
gridTemplateColumns: 1fr;
gap: 3;
```

Columns automatically stack vertically on mobile devices.

### Visual Design Enhancements

1. **Numbered Progression:**
   - Chips with "1", "2", "3" guide users
   - Maintains consistent header style across columns

2. **Card-Based UI:**
   - Sources displayed as individual cards
   - Clear visual separation
   - Better hit targets for touch devices

3. **Gradient Button:**
   - Vibrant blue-to-cyan gradient
   - Dramatic shadow effect
   - Play icon for visual emphasis
   - Disabled state clearly indicated

4. **KPI Cards:**
   - Outlined variant for subtle emphasis
   - Large numbers (h4) for readability
   - Caption text for context
   - Stacked vertically for mobile

5. **State Transitions:**
   - Smooth visual changes between states
   - Clear loading indicators
   - Proper error handling

### Accessibility Improvements

1. **Semantic Structure:**
   - Numbered sections provide clear progression
   - Proper heading hierarchy maintained
   - Cards use CardActionArea for better keyboard nav

2. **Interactive Elements:**
   - All buttons have proper focus states
   - Help icon has tooltip
   - Radio buttons for clear selection
   - ARIA labels where appropriate

3. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Selected state clearly visible (blue border)
   - Hover states provide feedback
   - Disabled states clearly indicated
   - Loading states prevent confusion

### Performance Considerations

1. **Limited Results:**
   - Source list limited to 50 items for performance
   - Full results use pagination (existing)
   - Preview shows only 10 items

2. **Memoization:**
   - Existing useMemo hooks maintained
   - No additional re-renders introduced

3. **WebSocket:**
   - Existing real-time update system maintained
   - Connection status clearly displayed

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **All existing features preserved:**
- Analysis mode selection (coverage/filter)
- Word list management
- Sentence limit configuration
- Source selection from history
- Import from Google Sheets
- Run execution with credit validation
- Real-time progress updates
- Results display and export
- CSV download
- Google Sheets export

✅ **No breaking changes:**
- All API calls unchanged
- State management unchanged
- WebSocket integration unchanged
- React Query hooks unchanged

✅ **URL parameters still work:**
- `?source=history&id=123` - Pre-selects source
- `?runId=456` - Loads existing run

## Migration Notes

### For Future Developers

1. **Column Structure:**
   - Each column is a `<Box>` within a CSS Grid
   - Responsive breakpoint at `md` (900px)
   - Adjust column widths by modifying `gridTemplateColumns`

2. **Adding New Features:**
   - Column 1: Add to configuration Stack
   - Column 2: Modify source card structure
   - Column 3: Add to appropriate state section

3. **Styling:**
   - Use Material-UI v7 syntax
   - Spacing units (1 = 8px)
   - Theme colors via `sx` prop

4. **State Management:**
   - Local state for UI-only concerns
   - React Query for server data
   - WebSocket for real-time updates

### Known Limitations

1. **Cancel Functionality:**
   - Button present but disabled
   - Requires backend support
   - Noted in UI with "Coming soon" text

2. **Authentication Required:**
   - Page protected by RouteGuard
   - Redirects to login if not authenticated
   - Cannot screenshot full functionality easily

3. **Backend Dependency:**
   - Requires running backend for full testing
   - API endpoints must be available
   - WebSocket server must be running

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

1. Revert the single commit: `git revert 262118f`
2. Or restore from backup:
   ```bash
   git checkout b12e3c5 -- frontend/src/app/coverage/page.tsx
   ```

No database migrations or API changes required, making rollback safe and simple.

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test with real backend running
   - Verify all user workflows
   - Check responsive behavior
   - Validate accessibility

2. **Potential Enhancements:**
   - Add cancel functionality (requires backend)
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to run)
   - Add configuration presets
   - Add drag-and-drop file upload
   - Add export history integration

3. **User Feedback:**
   - Gather feedback on new layout
   - Monitor usage analytics
   - Iterate based on user needs

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time to configure and run analysis
- Increased user satisfaction with workflow
- Fewer support questions about the interface
- Higher completion rate for coverage runs
- Better mobile usability scores
