## API Usage Summary

### Word List Management
```typescript
// List all accessible word lists
listWordLists() → { wordlists: WordList[] }

// Create from CSV file
createWordListFromFile(file, name, foldDiacritics) 
  → { wordlist: WordList, ingestion_report: IngestionReport }

// Create from Google Sheets
createWordListFromWords(name, words, 'google_sheet', sheetId, foldDiacritics, includeHeader)
  → { wordlist: WordList, ingestion_report: IngestionReport }

// Update word list
updateWordList(id, { name }) → WordList

// Delete word list
deleteWordList(id) → void
```

### Coverage Runs
```typescript
// Create coverage run
createCoverageRun({
  mode: 'coverage' | 'filter',
  source_type: 'job' | 'history',
  source_id: number,
  wordlist_id?: number,
  config?: { ... }
}) → { coverage_run: CoverageRun, task_id: string }

// Get run status and results
getCoverageRun(runId, page?, perPage?) 
  → { coverage_run: CoverageRun, assignments: CoverageAssignment[], pagination: {...} }

// Export results
exportCoverageRun(runId, sheetName) 
  → { spreadsheet_url: string, spreadsheet_id: string }

// Download CSV
downloadCoverageRunCSV(runId) → Blob
```

## Configuration Options

### Filter Mode Config
```typescript
{
  min_in_list_ratio: 0.95,  // 95% of words must be in list
  len_min: 4,                // Minimum sentence length
  len_max: 8,                // Maximum sentence length
  target_count: 500          // Target number of sentences
}
```

### Coverage Mode Config
```typescript
{
  alpha: 0.5,     // Weight for sentence quality
  beta: 0.3,      // Weight for word coverage
  gamma: 0.2      // Weight for uniqueness
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Polling Interval**: 2 seconds for run status updates
- **Pagination**: Default 25 items per page, supports up to 100
- **Search**: Client-side filtering for current page results
- **Large Result Sets**: Use pagination to avoid loading all assignments at once

## Known Limitations

1. **Swap/Exclude Actions**: UI ready but backend endpoints not yet implemented
2. **Real-time Progress**: Uses polling instead of WebSocket
3. **Direct ID Entry**: Removed in favor of history search (cleaner UX)
4. **Ingestion Report Dialog**: Shows as success alert instead of modal (simpler)

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term (Phase 3)
- Implement swap assignment backend endpoint
- Implement exclude sentence backend endpoint
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Performance optimization for large result sets

### Medium-term
- WebSocket support for real-time progress
- Batch operations (swap multiple, exclude multiple)
- Advanced filtering UI (score range, word count range)
- Result export templates (custom column selection)

### Long-term
- Offline result viewing (cached runs)
- Comparison view (compare two runs)
- Analytics dashboard (usage stats, popular word lists)
- Collaborative features (share word lists, runs)

## Documentation

- **User Guide**: `/docs/VOCABULARY_COVERAGE_USER_GUIDE.md`
- **Technical Spec**: `/docs/VOCABULARY_COVERAGE_TOOL.md`
- **API Routes**: `/backend/app/coverage_routes.py`
- **Services**: `/backend/app/services/coverage_service.py`, `wordlist_service.py`
- **Models**: `/backend/app/models.py` (WordList, CoverageRun, CoverageAssignment)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Planned)
- CoverageRunDialog: Mode selection, word list selection, API calls
- CoverageResultsTable: Search, pagination, data display
- FilterResultsTable: Ranking, stats calculation, visual indicators

### Integration Tests (Planned)
- Word list upload → ingestion → default selection → run creation
- Job completion → CTA → coverage run → results view
- History entry → CTA → coverage run → export

### E2E Tests (Planned)
- Full flow from PDF upload to coverage export
- Multiple word list management
- Error handling and recovery

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All CRUD operations for word lists working
- ✅ Both coverage modes (Coverage & Filter) functional
- ✅ CTAs integrated in job and history flows
- ✅ Results display with search and pagination
- ✅ Export to Google Sheets and CSV working
- ✅ User-friendly error messages and loading states
- ✅ Responsive design across devices

## Conclusion

Phase 2 delivers a production-ready UI for the Vocabulary Coverage Tool. Users can now manage word lists, run coverage analysis from multiple entry points, view detailed results, and export to Google Sheets or CSV. The implementation is clean, maintainable, and ready for Phase 3 enhancements.
