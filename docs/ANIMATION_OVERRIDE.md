# Animation Override Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of forced animations override, which intentionally ignores OS/browser `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility settings to ensure consistent animations across all platforms.

## Motivation
Per product requirements (issue #23), the application needs to display animations consistently on all desktop browsers, regardless of the user's OS accessibility settings for reduced motion.

## Implementation

### Changes Made

#### File: `frontend/src/app/globals.css`

**Location:** Lines 219-241

**What Changed:**
- Previously, the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block disabled all animations and transitions by setting:
  - `scroll-behavior: auto` (disabled smooth scrolling)
  - `animation-duration: 0.01ms !important` (effectively disabled animations)
  - `animation-iteration-count: 1 !important` (prevented looping)
  - `transition-duration: 0.01ms !important` (effectively disabled transitions)

- Now, the same media query **forces animations to remain active** by:
  - `scroll-behavior: smooth !important` (keeps smooth scrolling)
  - `animation-duration: initial !important` (restores default animation durations)
  - `animation-iteration-count: initial !important` (restores default iteration counts)
  - `transition-duration: initial !important` (restores default transition durations)

**Selector Change:**
- Changed from `*` to `:root *` for higher specificity to ensure the override takes precedence

## Affected Animations

The following animations will now remain active even when the OS/browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:

### CSS Keyframe Animations
1. **float** - Hero aura effect (9s and 11s variants)
2. **pulse** - Upload icon animation (2s infinite)
3. **bounce** - Drag feedback animation
4. **spin** - Loading spinners
5. **fadeIn** - Fade-in transitions for content

### Transitions
- Theme switching (background-color, color)
- Focus ring animations
- Button hover effects
- Card gradient effects
- Skip link transitions

### Smooth Scrolling
- HTML smooth scroll behavior remains active

## Verification Checklist

### Code Verification ✅
- [x] Only one instance of `prefers-reduced-motion` in codebase (now overridden)
- [x] No Framer Motion library in use
- [x] No JavaScript/TypeScript code checking for reduced-motion preferences
- [x] No other animation libraries with motion preferences

### Testing Recommendations

To verify the implementation works correctly:

1. **Enable Reduced Motion in OS:**
   - **macOS:** System Settings → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
   - **Windows:** Settings → Accessibility → Visual effects → Animation effects (toggle off)
   - **Linux:** Varies by desktop environment (GNOME: gnome-tweaks → Animations)

2. **Test in Browsers:**
   - Chrome/Edge: DevTools → Rendering → Emulate CSS media feature `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
   - Firefox: DevTools → Inspector → Add rule `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`

3. **Verify Animations:**
   - Upload page hover effects (pulse animation)
   - Drag and drop feedback (bounce animation)
   - Loading spinners (CircularProgress with fadeIn)
   - Hero section aura effects (float animation)
   - Smooth scrolling behavior
   - Theme switch transitions

## Important Notes

### Accessibility Consideration
⚠️ **This implementation intentionally overrides accessibility settings.** 

Users who have enabled "Reduce Motion" in their operating system or browser preferences will still see animations. This decision was made per explicit product requirements (#23) and should be:
- Documented in user-facing materials if animations may cause discomfort
- Periodically reviewed to ensure it aligns with product goals and user feedback
- Considered for potential future toggle in application settings

### Browser Compatibility
The `initial` keyword for CSS properties is widely supported:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support
- Firefox: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ✅ Full support
- All modern browsers support this approach

### Future Considerations
If user feedback indicates that forced animations are problematic, consider:
1. Adding an in-app toggle for animations (separate from OS settings)
2. Reducing animation intensity rather than fully disabling
3. Providing animation preferences in user settings
